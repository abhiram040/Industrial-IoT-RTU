The main aim of the project is to monitor the various parameters like temperature, humidity and pressure in the harsh industrial environment 
using the Remote terminal units and sending the data to common gateway from where the data is pushed to cloud. when the temperature is more than its threshold, the data in cloud is fetched by a
smart coolant pump which turns on automatically.
